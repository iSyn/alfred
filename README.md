### Proposal

##### A clear problem statement from the client
"Help! There are way too many sticky notes on my desk. I need a dashboard application that will contain my upcoming tasks as well as many other important information of my business."

##### What business problem are you trying to solve with technology?
Workflow issues as well as general confusion in a hectic environment.

##### Clearly present technical requirements of solving the business problem
- Have a list of recent activity.
- Be able to search through all activity
- Be able to [view/create/delete/update] [tasks/memos/orders/support]
- Have graphs to visualize data.

##### Why monolith?
Alfred is designed for small, up and coming businesses so the need of microservices would be an overkill. Implementing microservices would actually end up slowing performance unless your business is extremely successful.
